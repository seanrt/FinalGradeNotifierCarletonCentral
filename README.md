# FinalGradeNotifierCarletonCentral

This script is for Carleton University students. It checks Carleton Central to see if final grades have been posted for a given semester.

The user inputs their student number, their pin, and the semester they want to check. The script then continuously checks for and prints courses which have final grades posted.

This script was written in Python 3 and uses the bs4 library (BeautifulSoup).
